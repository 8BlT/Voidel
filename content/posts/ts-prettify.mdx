## Introduction

Typescript has been helping me to prevent a bug from appearing from the pit of the abyss by inferring a possible error in my code.

On top of that, Typescript has been increasing my codebase's readability, so other developers will not be confused when reading my code.

But sometimes, typescript compiler is annoying, especially about it's type-system, in this post, I want to share about nested types.

## Nested Type

What is nested type?.

Types that are defined inside of other types, interfaces, or classes are referred to as "nested types" in TypeScript.

These nested types can be used to represent intricate relationships and data structures. They are additionally referred to as "nested or inner types" and might offer a means of grouping or organizing similar type definitions.

Let's see how nested type works.

```ts title="@/person.ts" showLineNumbers
type Address = {
  street: string
  city: string
}

type Person = {
  name: string
  age: number
  homeAddress: Address
}
```

The above example show, a person can contain an address type, therefore everytime the `Address`.

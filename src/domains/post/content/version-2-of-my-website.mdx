## New app directory (Beta)

Today, we're improving the routing and layouts experience in Next.js and aligning with the future of React with the introduction of the `app` directory. This is a follow-up to the [Layouts RFC]('https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc' 'layout RFC') previously published for community feedback.

The `app` directory is currently in beta and we do not recommend using it in production yet. You can use Next.js 13 with the `pages` directory with stable features like the improved next/image and next/link components, and opt into the `app` directory at your own pace. The `pages` directory will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.

The `app` directory includes support for:

- [Layouts:](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#layouts) Easily share UI between routes while preserving state and avoiding expensive re-renders.
- [Server Components:](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#server-components) Making server-first the default for the most dynamic applications.
- [Streaming:](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#streaming) Display instant loading states and stream in units of UI as they are rendered.
- [Support for Data Fetching:](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#data-fetching) async Server Components and extended fetch API enables component-level fetching.

### Layouts

The `app/` directory makes it easy to lay out complex interfaces that maintain state across navigations, avoid expensive re-renders, and enable advanced routing patterns. Further, you can nest layouts, and colocate application code with your routes, like components, tests, and styles.

Creating routes inside app/ requires a single file, page.js:

```js title="foo" filename="bar" fileName="Bazz"
// This file maps to the index route (/)
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

You can then define layouts through the file system. Layouts share UI between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render.

```js
export default function BlogLayout({ children }) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

[Learn more about layouts and pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/fundamentals) or [deploy an example to try it out](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/app-directory).

### Server Components

The `app/` directory introduces support for React's new Server Components architecture. Server and Client Components use the server and the client each for what they're best at - allowing you to build fast, highly-interactive apps with a single programming model that provides a great developer experience.

With Server Components, we're laying the foundations to build complex interfaces while reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, enabling faster initial page loads.

When a route is loaded, the Next.js and React runtime will be loaded, which is cacheable and predictable in size. This runtime does not increase in size as your application grows. Further, the runtime is asynchronously loaded, enabling your HTML from the server to be progressively enhanced on the client.

### Streaming

The `app/` directory introduces the ability to progressively render and incrementally stream rendered units of the UI to the client.

With Server Components and [nested layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/pages-and-layouts) in Next.js, you're able instantly render parts of the page that do not specifically require data, and show a l[oading state](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/loading-ui) for parts of the page that are fetching data. With this approach, the user does not have to wait for the entire page to load before they can start interacting with it.

When deployed to Vercel, Next.js 13 applications that use the app/ directory will stream responses by default in both the Node.js and Edge runtimes for improved performance.

### Data Fetching

React's recent Support for [Promises RFC](https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/first-class-promises/text/0000-first-class-support-for-promises.md) introduces a powerful new way to fetch data and handle promises inside components:

```js
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')
  // The return value is *not* serialized
  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.
  return res.json()
}

// This is an async Server Component
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()

  return <main>{/* ... */}</main>
}
```

The native fetch Web API has also been extended in React and Next.js. It automatically dedupes fetch requests and provides one flexible way to fetch, cache, and revalidate data at the component level. This means all the benefits of Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are now available through one API:

```js
// This request should be cached until manually invalidated.
// Similar to `getStaticProps`.
// `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.
fetch(URL, { cache: 'force-cache' })

// This request should be refetched on every request.
// Similar to `getServerSideProps`.
fetch(URL, { cache: 'no-store' })

// This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.
// Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.
fetch(URL, { next: { revalidate: 10 } })
```

In the `app` directory, you can fetch data inside layouts, pages, and components - including support for streaming responses from the server.

We're enabling ergonomic ways to handle loading and error states and stream in UI as it's rendered. In a future release, we'll be improving and simplifying data mutations, as well.

![Next.js Streaming](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fblog%2Fnext-13%2Fstreaming.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_65Ea6uJgAkKmxLzREQQvUSHoH1sq 'next.js loading state')

We're excited to work with the open-source community, package maintainers, and other companies contributing to the React ecosystem to build for this new era of React and Next.js. The ability to colocate data fetching inside components and ship less JavaScript to the client were two important pieces of community feedback we are excited to include with the app/ directory.

## Introducing Turbopack (Alpha)

Next.js 13 includes [Turbopack](https://vercel.com/blog/turbopack), the new Rust-based successor to Webpack.

Webpack has been downloaded over 3 billion times. While it's been an integral part of building the Web, we've hit the limits of the maximum performance possible with JavaScript-based tooling.

In Next.js 12, we began our transition to native Rust-powered tooling. We started by migrating away from Babel, which resulted in 17x faster transpilation. Then, we replaced Terser, which resulted in 6x faster minification. It's time to go all-in on native for bundling.

Using the Turbopack alpha with Next.js 13 results in:

- 700x faster updates than Webpack
- 10x faster updates than Vite
- 4x faster cold starts than Webpack

[Turbopack](https://vercel.com/blog/turbopack) only bundles the minimum assets required in development, so startup time is extremely fast. On an application with 3,000 modules, Turbopack takes 1.8 seconds to boot up. Vite takes 11.4 seconds and Webpack takes 16.5 seconds.

Turbopack has out-of-the-box support for Server Components, TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more. During the alpha, [many features](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/features) are not yet supported. We'd love to hear your feedback on using Turbopack to speed up your local iterations.

> Note: Turbopack in Next.js currently only supports next dev. View the supported features. We are also working to add support for next build through Turbopack.

Try out the Turbopack alpha today in Next.js 13 with `next dev --turbo`.

## next/image

Next.js 13 introduces a powerful new Image component, allowing you to easily display images without layout shift and optimize files on-demand for increased performance.

During the Next.js Community Survey, 70% of respondents told us they used the Next.js Image component in production, and in turn, saw improved Core Web Vitals. With Next.js 13, we're improving next/image even further.

The new Image component:

- Ships less client-side JavaScript
- Easier to style and configure
- More accessible requiring alt tags by default
- Aligns with the Web platform
- Faster because native lazy loading doesn't require hydration

```js
import avatar from './lee.png'

import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Home() {
  // "alt" is now required for improved accessibility
  // optional: image files can be colocated inside the app/ directory
  return <Image alt='leeerob' src={avatar} placeholder='blur' />
}
```

### Upgrading next/image to Next.js 13

The old Image component was renamed to `next/legacy/image`. We've provided a codemod that will automatically update your existing usage of next/image to `next/legacy/image`. For example, this command would run the codemod on your `./pages` directory when run from the root:

## @next/font

Next.js 13 introduces a brand new font system that:

- Automatically optimizes your fonts, including custom fonts
- Removes external network requests for improved privacy and performance
- Built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file
- Zero layout shift automatically using the CSS size-adjust property

This new font system allows you to conveniently use all Google Fonts with performance and privacy in mind. CSS and font files are downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static assets. No requests are sent to Google by the browser.

```js
import { Inter } from '@next/font/google'

const inter = Inter()

return <html className={inter.className}></html>
```

Custom fonts are also supported, including support for automatic self-hosting, caching, and preloading of font files.

```js
import localFont from '@next/font/local'

const myFont = localFont({ src: './my-font.woff2' })

return <html className={myFont.className}></html>
```

You can customize every part of the font loading experience while still ensuring great performance and no layout shift, including the font-display, preloading, fallbacks, and more.

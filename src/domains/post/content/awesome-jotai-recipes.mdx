## Introduction

Jotai is an awesome state manager for React. It's an _atomic_ state manager; meaning any state you declare is considered as an _atom_, and we can combine those atoms into bigger scale, like _molecules_. This pattern benefits us as we're using React with functional component and _functional programming_.

> opensource.com has great explanation [about functional programming](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/functional-javascript 'functional programming by opensource.com')

If you read this blog, I'm assuming you're already know about [Jotai](https://jotai.org 'jotai website'). If not, you can read [my post explaining about Jotai](/blog/jotai-awesome-state-management 'read about jotai').

Jotai use terms _recipes_ to mutate any states within React. In this post, I'm going to share some of awesome jotai recipes I've been used.

## Filter Data

Filter data is a common way we use to filter data based on anything we provide, usually an arrays that contain object, and each object contain a property that we want to filter out.

```ts
// let's assume this data sends by Elon from Mars using an express.js app

const pizzas = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Large pepperoni pizza (hand-tossed)', price: 14.9 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Medium pepperoni pizza', price: 11.9 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Personal pepperoni pizza', price: 4.79 },
]
```

See, we have list of pizzas here, but right now, we kinda broke because it's _end-of-the-month_ and we only have a few dollars left on our _Cash App_. So we only buy affordable pizzas that cost us less than 10 dollars.

```ts
import { atom } from 'jotai'

const atomPizzas = atom(pizzas) // remember the previous data from Elon

export const atomCheapPizza = atom((get) => get(atomPizzas).find((pizza) => pizza.price < 10))
```

And on our component.

```tsx
import { atomCheapPizza } from '@/store'

import { useAtomValue } from 'jotai'

function MyPizza() {
  const pizza = useAtomValue()


  console.log(pizza) -> // {id: 3, name: 'Personal pepperoni pizza', price: 4.79}

  return (
    <div>
    <p>Pizza name: {pizza.name}</p>
    <p>Pizza price: {pizza.price}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

It looks like we get the Personal pepperoni pizza, as it cost less than 10 dollars to buy. and we get the data as a single object. Here's a bit explanation about it:

1. We fetch a pizzas from an api
2. Get the data, assign it to atom
3. But before sending the state to the component retrieve any pizzas that cost less than 10 dollars

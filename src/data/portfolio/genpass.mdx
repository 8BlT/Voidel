Genpass is a password generator, aside from it's simple UI, the functionality is focused to help me generate a random string, it can either be only number or string, or even can be mixed.

Tech stack:

- Vite
- Tailwindcss

## Is This Useful?

Yes, but I think this is for practice purpose though, but another use case is to practice about DOM manipulation and string manipulation.

## Live Site and GitHub repository

I've deployed this to vercel, and stored the codebase at GitHub, if you're interested either to see the deployed app or just the code base, please look forward to the following link:

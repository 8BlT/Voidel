Genpass is a password generator, aside from it's simple UI, the functionality is focused to help me generate a random string, it can either be only number or string, or even can be mixed.

Tech stack:

- Vite
- Tailwindcss

## How To Create it

How about create this as a practice to sharpen a bit of our logic? this is only a small project, that you can actually built in only 1 Hour, and there's a lot of project to build out there.

But if you insist, and interested to build this while you're on a free time, then let's grab a coffee and boot up your machine.

### Installing Node.JS

But first thing first, let us install Node.js on our _machine_ go to <Link href="https://nodejs.org" newTab>Node.js Official Website</Link>, downlaod and install the node.js on your _machine_.

After installation done, open your fav IDE, anything are okay, such as _Atom_, _Sublime Text_ or _Vim_, but mine are <Link href="https://code.visualstudio.com" newTab>Visual Studio Code</Link>.

### Initialize Vite

After opened your IDE, open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
npm init vite@latest
```

You will be see this first prompt:

<Image
  layout='intrinsic'
  src='/static/vite-init.png'
  alt='vite init project'
  loading='lazy'
  width={512}
  height={80}
  className=''
/>

Follow the prompt ahead, and choose vanilla javascript for the starter, vite will generate a folder structure for you as a starter.

### Using Tailwind CSS

The next step is to install all the dependency needed to build our app, the dependencies we're using are:

- tailwindcss
- autoprefixer
- postcss

including vite itself, run the following command on your terminal:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss autoprefixer postcss
```

This will download all the packages needed, but actually we're not even installing any dependencies, this project only install all the packages as a **devDependencies** which mean all the packages used only on development.

The `&&` command will run the next line command, which is:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

And it will soon initialize tailwindcss config file, creating 2 files: `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`, you don't have to know about `postcss.config.js` file, but let's look up to the `tailwind.config.js` file.

This file used to configure our tailwindcss, like theme, spacing or screen size, the given default config from tailwindcss are:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },
  plugins: []
}
```

Change the above code, add array of string in the content property to match to our folder structure, which would be like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./**/*.html', 'src/**/*.{js,ts}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },
  plugins: []
}
```

## Live Site and GitHub repository

I've deployed this to vercel, and stored the codebase at GitHub, if you're interested either to see the deployed app or just the code base, please look forward to the following link:

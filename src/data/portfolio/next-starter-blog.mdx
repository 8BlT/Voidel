## Introduction

Blog has always a nice to have thing for everyone, especially for developer.

Everyone loves writing, we love to express our voice through this way, some want to be more than a blog, they teach people how to do things right, but that's not all the important things.

On the other side, because of blog we write, new people starting to know us, right?.

### Why I Made This?

I learn something while making this, for me as a Frontend dev, who spent most of my time coding in frontend techs such as JavaScript and CSS is easy to build something like this.

The problem comes when a Backend dev, or even a Fullstack dev try to build their personal website or blog.

So to help people achive their desire of creating a personal website with blog in, I made this starter to quickly speed up a personal website with blog.

### Tech Stack

- 👾 NEXT.js for the core
- 🌀 Jotai for your app's state
- 🧰 TypeScript for the language
- 📝 MDX for the Blog
- 💅 Tailwind CSS for styling
- 🌠 Framer Motion for animation
- 💎 Prism to highlight your code blocks

### Features

- ⚡ Fast and scalable, **Static Site Generator** based website, and **SEO Optimization**.
- 🎯 Match your own preference, use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ 'tailwind css') for styling, a _utility-first_ css framework, easy to customize.
- ✍ Just write, and publish, simple. Use markdown to write a blog, you simply just write a markup language.
- 💎 Syntax Highlighting support, showoff your snippet on the blog, write code, and the app will give the color.

## Could I Use This?

If you think you can't use this for your personal website, you are totally wrong.

I build this to help people solve the problem when it comes building frontend app, if you have no time to configure things like UI, and UX, and you probably just want to straight to writing and pubslished it, then this would be fit for you.

### How To Create My First Blog?

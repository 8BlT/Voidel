## Introduction

After deploying website to the internet, we were happy because finally the world can now accessed it.

Analytics are a good way to track our websites' traffic, such as page views and visitors.

Take one example, we have a blog that shows about technology blog, every people that visits website got tracked, where they came from **e.g: Indonesia** and what web browser they used, **e.g: chrome**.

When it comes to analytics, you might think about **Google Analytics**, it's a a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic, but you also tired of being tracked by big company? _just kiding_.

Then [Umami](https://umami.is) may be the right choice, Umami is a simple, fast, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics, let's see how we can use this platform as our web analytics.

### Prerequisite

Before we continue, we need to prepare the tech stack we need, as from umamis' official website, here's what we need:

- A server with Node.js 12 or newer - we are going to use [vercel](https://vercel.com)
- A database (MySQL or Postgresql) - we are going to use [supabase](https://supabase.com)

## Using Supabase

Before getting to Umami itself, let's create a database on supabase.

Supabase is an open source alternative to Firebase, a collection of tools that helps developers build projects more quickly by automatically handling a whole lot of the behind-the-scenes work and wiring.

### Create Supabase Account

Go to supabase official website, create an account, or login if you already have one, create a new project.

Fill in the forms fields based on your personal preferences, and then select the closest region to your area in the form field.

### Configuring Schema

Next up you need to configure the database schema on the supabase project, copy and paste [this code](https://github.com/mikecao/umami/blob/master/sql/schema.postgresql.sql, 'PostgreSQL Schema') on your supabase project on **SQL Editor**.

The code simply run and create tables and wire up your database schema.

### Environtment Variables

After you've created a database, go to your projects' setting, and see for postgre query string:
